// Netlify does not support Github Packages (or other private package registries besides npm), options are:
//   - Commit .npmrc to repo - However, now we have a secret token inside our repo
//   - Environment variable in .npmrc - However, this requires all developer machines to have the same environment variable configured
//   - Get creative with the preinstall script... :)

// Only run this script on Netlify
