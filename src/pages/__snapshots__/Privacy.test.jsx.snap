          Bldrs Share (“we,” “us,” “our”) provides open-source, browser-first tools for viewing and collaborating on 3D model files (e.g., IFC, STEP) using our Conway Engine. We design our software to minimize data collection and maximize user control.

          1. Information We Collect
        </h1>
        <p
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-17ggkq7-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          Bldrs Share is built to operate 
          <strong>
            without centralized data storage
          </strong>
          . We do not host user content or model data by default. Depending on your configuration:
        </p>
        <p
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-17ggkq7-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          <strong>
            Authentication data.
          </strong>
           When you sign in via Auth0/Google or another provider, we receive basic profile information (name, email, avatar) to create or identify your account.
        </p>
        <p
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-17ggkq7-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          <strong>
            Model data.
          </strong>
           Models you open are processed locally in your browser using WebAssembly. If you connect third-party storage (e.g., Google Drive), we only request access to the specific files you select. We do not scan or store other files from your account.
        </p>

          <strong>
            Telemetry (optional).
          </strong>
           If enabled in a hosted deployment, we may collect anonymized usage metrics (e.g., performance, feature use) to improve reliability and UX.
        </p>

          Most of our codebase (including Bldrs Share and Conway) is available under the
          <strong>
             GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)

        <p
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-17ggkq7-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          We use limited account and usage data to authenticate users; enable integrations (e.g., importing from Google Drive); improve performance, security, and usability; and communicate important service updates.
        </p>

          <strong>
            No persistent model storage by default.
          </strong>
           Model data is processed client-side and is not uploaded to our servers. Communication between your browser and our services uses HTTPS. Future, optional hosted collaboration features (e.g., Firestore for comments/sharing) may store limited user-generated data; if launched, this policy will be updated accordingly.
        </p>
