      <Typography variant='h3'>Why Bldrs Share & Conway Engine?</Typography>
      <Typography variant='p'>
        Engineering teams in the built world have been tethered to outdated desktop CAD tools,
        proprietary formats, and sluggish SaaS solutions. Drawing on our decades of experience in
        software innovation, Bldrs introduces a browser-first, real-time collaboration platform that
        supports federated versioning, open-source, and open-standard toolingâ€”tailored for modern
        workflows and designed for architects, engineers, industrial designers, manufacturers, and
        operators leading the worldâ€™s most impactful projects.

        Share and Conway Engine are designed to help builder communities overcome the collaboration
        limitations common in current CAD tools. Modern cross-functional teams require frictionless,
        high-performance web-based visualization, real-time collaboration, visual issue tracking and
        seamless integration with automation.  Regardless of your discipline, Share and Conway Engine
        unlock a new level of capability in CAD model sharing.

        As an open-source project, Share will remain accessible, customizable, and adaptable for
        all users, from independent creators to large-scale enterprise teams.
